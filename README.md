# Connect Four

This is 'Connect Four' game against the computer.

I programmed the game so that there are 3 levels: <br>
First level - easy level, the computer plays randomly. <br>
Second level - medium level. <br>
Third level - a difficult to impossible level to win. At this level I implemented the Minimax algorithm that helped me get the desired result.

The backend is written in Python, and the frontend is written in Python and using pygame.
